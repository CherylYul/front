                <p class="blog-desc indent">
                    After several months of learning in the Frontend Developer Career Path, 
                    I've made the big jump over to the Bootcamp to get expert code reviews 
                    of my Solo Projects projects and meet like-minded peers.

                    How I stay committed to learning
                </p>
                <p class="space indent">
                    I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to spend hours and 
                    hours learning, then try to create simple projects using what I learned or 
                    work new techniques into existing projects.
                </p>
                <p class="space indent">
                    While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share what I was learning 
                    and most things about my journey with the world.
                </p>
                <p class="bold space indent">
                    How I got started
                </p>
                <p class="space indent">
                    I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. I would take 
                    notes about what I was learning. After each learning session, I'd use my notes 
                    to not only reflect on what I learned but also write short summaries of what I 
                    learned using my own words.
                </p>
                <p class="space indent">
                    That helped me grok what I was learning, and I realized that posting my learning 
                    summaries was also helping others learn and stay motivated.
