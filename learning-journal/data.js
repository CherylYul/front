            How I stay committed to learning
        </p>
        <p>
            I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to spend hours and 
            hours learning, then try to create simple projects using what I learned or 
            work new techniques into existing projects.
            While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share what I was learning 
            and most things about my journey with the world.

            How I got started
        </p>
        <p>
            I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. I would take 
            notes about what I was learning. After each learning session, I'd use my notes 
            to not only reflect on what I learned but also write short summaries of what I 
            learned using my own words.
            That helped me grok what I was learning, and I realized that posting my learning 
            summaries was also helping others learn and stay motivated.
